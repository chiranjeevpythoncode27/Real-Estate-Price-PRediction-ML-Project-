Machine Learning Project: From Data to Model Deployment
Overview
This project is a comprehensive machine learning pipeline that guides you from fetching raw data, through cleaning and preprocessing, to building a predictive model. The end goal is to create a robust, scalable machine learning solution that can be deployed in real-world scenarios.

**Project Workflow**
1. Fetching the Data
The first step in our pipeline involves acquiring the dataset. We use a variety of data sources, including public APIs, CSV files, and databases, to retrieve the necessary raw data. The data fetched in this step is often noisy, inconsistent, and requires preprocessing before use.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
After fetching the raw data, we move into the cleaning phase. This involves:

Handling missing values
Removing duplicates
Normalizing or scaling numerical features
Encoding categorical variables
Splitting the data into training and test sets.
This process ensures that the data is in an optimal format for the model to learn effectively and accurately.

3. Model Creation
Once the data is preprocessed, we dive into model building. We experiment with various algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Our model is fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques to ensure the best performance.

4. Running the Program
Finally, we run the program to train and test the model. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess the model's performance.
